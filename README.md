# Project 6 - InstaPhotos

**Name of your app** is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [x] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [x] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [x] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [x] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Show the username and creation time for each post
- [x] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse.
- [x] User Profiles:
   - [x] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
   - [x] Display the profile photo with each post
   - [x] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Cool animations when text user taps on caption text view
- [x] tab bar controller and transferring data between tabs
- [x] customize UI

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. An error keeps occuring in the comsol along the lines of "this" is not a valid storage file. This internet says it can be safely ignored and that it occurs when creating a UIImage from data. Why does thsi happen?
2. More in depth on subclassing tabBarController to transfer data between tabs vs. using delegates

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- [x] The remote Mac server I use (since I have a PC) went down on Sunday. They still have not gotten it fixed, and in he meantime they assigned me an account on a different server. That being said, I did not get access to that new account until Monday, and then ahd to redo a bunch of things because they were saved on the old server and I hadn't pushed them to github before it crashed. :-)
